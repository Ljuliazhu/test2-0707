    "In this application, you will explore a dataset from kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing. Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car."

We can also predict the used car price  with over 60% confidence.  The top features and relative weight to predict the price are listed as below\n",

    "   2. One area that was counter-intuitive in this result is that the brand of the car did not seem to have much impact on the price.  I suspect that this is because that the manufacturer and model are difficult to translate to numerical values. As a next step, it is worth testing is to add a new parameter such as orignal price to capture that information of the car's brand/model (hence original value)."
